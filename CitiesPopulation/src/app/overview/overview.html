  <h1 class="overview-title">Overview Dashboard</h1>
  <p class="overview-description">The web application features a secure login system that grants access to a Dashboard page with two main sections: 
    Overview and Cities. 
    The Overview page provides instructions on how to use the application. 
    The Cities page includes a text input where users can enter a city name, 
    which triggers an API call to the backend. 
    The backend queries a SQLite database for matching city records and returns the results, 
    which are then displayed dynamically on the frontend.</p>
    <p class="overview-description">The application is developed using Angular for the frontend, 
      .NET for the backend API, and SQLite as the database, 
      enabling efficient data retrieval and user-friendly interaction.</p>
